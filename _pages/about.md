I am an assistant professor in [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I am generally interested in deep learning, representation learning, and dynamical systems.<br/> 

<b>Open positions</b>: I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. research assistants. Email me with your CV and a brief introduction of your research interests to kookjin.lee@asu.edu.
