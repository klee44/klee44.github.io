I will be joining [School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering](https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) as an assistant professor in summer 2021. I am generally interested in deep learning, representation learning, and dynamical systems.
